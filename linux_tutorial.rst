A short tutorial to the Linux command line
==========================================

This document is a very short introduction to the linux systems used at the Univeristy of Innsbruck and the Linux command line. 

It was largely inspired from the first parts of Michael Stonebank's `UNIX tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html>`_

What is Linux and why should I use it?
--------------------------------------

The `world wide web <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Linux%3F>`_ is going to give a better answer than me to the first question.

I think that every student in sciences should know about the existence of Linux and know the basics of it. Meteorology students in particular will have to use it soon or late, as it is highly probable that most of the the tools and data they are using are running or have been created on Linux systems.

Linux has always been an environment for programmers and has the reputation of beiing "geeky" and "complicated", but this is less true today, with many Linux distributions becoming mainstream and easy to use (my current personal favorite is `Mint <http://linuxmint.com/>`_).  

I personnaly think that Linux is even more user-friendly than Windows: once some particularities of its functioning are understood (which can be frustrating in the beginning since it works *very* differently than windows), one can see that there is much less "hidden" in Linux than in Windows, especially when installing/deinstalling softwares.

Its command line utilities are very powerful, but we are just learning the basics of it here in order to get started with Python.

Linux at the UIBK
-----------------

In order to use Linux in the computer room you have to register for an account `here <http://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public_prod/owa/uvw$web$10.p001>`_. After an hour or so you will be able to connect to any computer using your username and password.
